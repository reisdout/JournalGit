Congestion control is the core networking task of modulating traffic sources’ data-transmission rates to efficiently utilize network capacity, and is the subject of extensive attention in light of the advent of Internet services such as live video, virtual reality, Internet-of-Things, and more. We show that casting congestion control as RL enables training deep network policies that capture intricate patterns in data traffic and network conditions, and leverage this to outperform the state-of-the-art. We also highlight significant challenges facing real-world adoption of RL-based congestion control, including fairness, safety, and generalization, which are not trivial to address within conventional RL formalism. To facilitate further research and reproducibility of our results, we present a test suite for RL-guided congestion control based on the OpenAI Gym interface.}

	abstract = {Advances in wireless technology have resulted in pervasive deployment of devices of a high variability in form factors, memory and computational ability. The need for maintaining continuous connections that deliver data with high reliability necessitate re-thinking of conventional design of the transport layer protocol. This paper investigates the use of Q-learning in TCP cwnd adaptation during the congestion avoidance state, wherein the classical alternation of the window is replaced, thereby allowing the protocol to immediately respond to previously seen network conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates how memory plays a critical role in building the exploration space, and proposes ways to reduce this overhead through function approximation. The superior performance of the learning-based approach over TCP New Reno is demonstrated through a comprehensive simulation study, revealing 33.8\% and 12.1\% improvement in throughput and delay, respectively, for the evaluated topologies. We also show how function approximation can be used to dramatically reduce the memory requirements of a learning-based protocol while maintaining the same throughput and delay.},

However, we argue that current clean-slate learning-based techniques bring practical issues and concerns such as overhead, convergence issues, and low performance over unseen network conditions to the table. To address these issues, we take a pragmatic and evolutionary approach combining classic congestion control strategies and advanced modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques and introduce a novel hybrid congestion control for the Internet named Orca1. Through extensive experiments done over global testbeds on the Internet and various locally emulated network conditions, we demonstrate that Orca is adaptive and achieves consistent high performance in different network conditions, while it can significantly alleviate the issues and problems of its clean-slate learning-based counterparts.},

	abstract = {The use of traditional TCP, in its present form, for reliable transport over Ad hoc Wireless Networks (AWNs) leads to signiﬁcant degradation in the network performance, in terms of reduction in average network throughput and increase in packet losses. This is primarily due to the congestion window updation and congestion control mechanisms employed by TCP. TCP follows a deterministic approach for updating the size of the congestion window, which is less suitable for loss-prone AWNs as it leads to very frequent occurrences of congestion in the network. Another reason is, TCP invokes the congestion control mechanism for both congestion and wireless losses, as it cannot distinguish between them. Hence, in order to use TCP in AWNs, an efﬁcient mechanism must be provided with TCP for updating the size of the congestion window based on the network conditions and distinguishing the congestion losses from wireless losses.},

	abstract = {Traditional congestion control algorithms were designed with a hardwired heuristic mapping between packetlevel events and predeﬁned control actions in response to these events, and may fail to satisfy all the desirable performance goals as a result. In this paper, we seek to reconsider these fundamental goals in congestion control, and propose Eagle, a new congestion control algorithm to reﬁne existing heuristics. Eagle takes advantage of expert knowledge from an existing algorithm, and uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train a generalized model with the hope of learning from an expert. Learning by trial-and-error may not be as efﬁcient as imitating a teacher; by the same token, DRL alone is not enough to guarantee good performance. In Eagle, we seek help from an expert congestion control algorithm, BBR, to help us train a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network in the DRL agent, with the hope of making decisions that can be as good as or even better than the expert. With an extensive array of experiments, we discovered that Eagle is able to match and even outperform the performance of its teacher, and outperformed a large number of recent congestion control algorithms by a considerable margin.},

However, the different network scenarios and various network applications associated with congestion would make it difﬁcult to maintain TCP throughput during this time. Thus, we focus on how a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based TCP throughput prediction method can improve throughput under the conditions of congestion to solve this problem. Our proposed method involves training an RNN on the metrics of a TCP connection to predict the TCP throughput. We prepared eight groups of metrics for training, and applied three types of RNNs (i.e., simple-RNN, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM)) in our method design. Under our congestion scenarios, a combination of metrics can contribute to improve the throughput. The throughput predicted via our method indicates that it performs better than the TCP CUBIC algorithm. Furthermore, the GRU-based predictive model demonstrated the best performance, achieving 35\% higher throughput than the TCP CUBIC algorithm.},

	abstract = {In this work, we attempt to improve the performance of TCP over ad hoc wireless networks (AWNs) by using a learning technique from the theory of learning automata. It is well-known that the use of TCP in its present form, for reliable transport over AWNs leads to unnecessary packet losses, thus limiting the achievable throughput. This is mainly due to the aggressive, reactive, and deterministic nature in updating its congestion window. As the AWNs are highly bandwidth constrained, the behavior of TCP leads to high contentions among the packets of the flow, thus causing a high amount of packet loss. This further leads to high power consumption at mobile nodes as the lost packets are recovered via several retransmissions at both TCP and MAC layers. Hence, our proposal, here after called as LearningTCP, focuses on updating the congestion window in an efficient manner (conservative, proactive, and finer and flexible update in the congestion window) in order to reduce the contentions and congestion, thus improving the performance of TCP in AWNs. The key advantage of Learning-TCP is that, without relying on any network feedback such as explicit congestion and link-failure notifications, it adapts to the changing network conditions and appropriately updates the congestion window by observing the interarrival times of TCP acknowledgments. We implemented Learning-TCP in ns-2.28 and Linux kernel 2.6 as well, and evaluated its performance for a wide range of network conditions. In all the studies, we observed that Learning-TCP outperforms TCP-Newreno by showing significant improvement in the goodput and reduction in the packet loss while maintaining higher fairness to the competing flows.},

	abstract = {Next generation network access technologies and Internet applications have increased the challenge of providing satisfactory quality of experience for users with traditional congestion control protocols. Efforts on optimizing the performance of TCP by modifying the core congestion control method depending on speciﬁc network architectures or apps do not generalize well under a wide range of network scenarios. This limitation arises from the rule-based design principle, where the performance is linked to a pre-decided mapping between the observed state of the network to the corresponding actions. Therefore, these protocols are unable to adapt their behavior in new environments or learn from experience for better performance. We address this problem by integrating a reinforcement-based Q-learning framework with TCP design in our approach called QTCP. QTCP enables senders to gradually learn the optimal congestion control policy in an on-line manner. QTCP does not need hard-coded rules, and can therefore generalize to a variety of different networking scenarios. Moreover, we develop a generalized Kanerva coding function approximation algorithm, which reduces the computation complexity of value functions and the searchable size of the state space. We show that QTCP outperforms the traditional rule-based TCP by providing 59.5\% higher throughput while maintaining low transmission latency.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural net models have been studied for many years in the hope of achieving human-like performance in the fields of speech and image recognition. These models are composed of many nonlinear computational elements operating in parallel and arranged in patterns reminiscent of biological neural nets. Computational elements or nodes are connected via weights that are typically adapted during use to improve performance. There has been a recent resurgence in the field of artificial neural nets caused by new net topologies and algorithms, analog VLSI implementation techniques, and the belief that massive parallelism is essential for high performance speech and image recognition. This paper provides an introduction to the field of artificial neural nets by reviewing six important neural net models that can be used for pattern classification. These nets are highly parallel building blocks that illustrate neural net components and design principles and can be used to construct more complex systems. In addition to describing these nets, a major emphasis is placed on exploring how some existing classification and clustering algorithms can be performed using simple neuron-like components. Single-layer nets can implement algorithms required by Gaussian maximum-likelihood classifiers and optimum minimum-error classifiers for binary patterns corrupted by noise. More generally, the decision regions required by any classification algorithm can be generated in a straightforward manner by three-layer feed-forward nets.},

Using simulation for a variety of network scenarios, it is shown that the rate based protocols based on one model underestimates while the other overestimates TCP bandwidth in the presence of errors. A modification is made to the models which allows us to construct a rate based protocol that can track TCP bandwidth better in the presence of random error and hence exhibit behavior that is more TCP-friendly.},

The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

We have therefore developed a new method called Keras2c, which is a simple library for converting Keras/TensorFlow neural network models into real-time compatible C code. It supports a wide range of Keras layers and model types including multidimensional convolutions, recurrent layers, multi-input/output models, and shared layers. Keras2c re-implements the core components of Keras/TensorFlow required for predictive forward passes through neural networks in pure C, relying only on standard library functions considered safe for real-time use. The core functionality consists of ∼ 1500 lines of code, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into existing codebases. Keras2c has been successfully tested in experiments and is currently in use on the plasma control system at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility at General Atomics in San Diego.},

Concept drift research involves the development of methodologies and techniques for drift detection, understanding and adaptation. Data analysis has revealed that machine learning in a concept drift environment will result in poor learning results if the drift is not addressed. To help researchers identify which research topics are signiﬁcant and how to apply related techniques in data analysis tasks, it is necessary that a high quality, instructive review of current research developments and trends in the concept drift ﬁeld is conducted. In addition, due to the rapid development of concept drift in recent years, the methodologies of learning under concept drift have become noticeably systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in literature. This paper reviews over 130 high quality publications in concept drift related research areas, analyzes up-to-date developments in methodologies and techniques, and establishes a framework of learning under concept drift including three main components: concept drift detection, concept drift understanding, and concept drift adaptation. This paper lists and discusses 10 popular synthetic datasets and 14 publicly available benchmark datasets used for evaluating the performance of learning algorithms aiming at handling concept drift. Also, concept drift related research directions are covered and discussed.
